# `Tourne'Table` **[Audio Visualizer]**

![Tourne'Table Audio Visualizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER-TOURNE/TOURNE-TABLE/main/GIF/11.gif)

*The Oscilloscope shape running live audio: bottom-left placement, blurred panel, single-pixel border.*

> **A real-time audio visualizer that lives on your Windows desktop.**
> Built on the foundation of Salyts' Desktop Audio Visualizer, rebuilt around performance.

Play music. Bars dance on your wallpaper. That's the whole idea.

It listens to **whatever your PC is already playing** (Spotify, YouTube, a game, a call) and draws it behind your desktop icons. No virtual audio cable, no drivers, nothing to configure. It just picks up your system audio.

It is built to be cheap to run. The render thread wakes only at the frame rate you ask for, the wallpaper blur is computed once instead of every frame, and the drawing surface is sized to the widget rather than the whole desktop, so at a 144 FPS target the visualizer costs about **a third of one CPU core** and **one degree** of CPU package temperature while it plays, and nothing at all while it doesn't.

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

Built with an emphasis on lower resource consumption, more efficient rendering, better frame pacing, expanded visualization options, dynamic album-art integration, native Windows media info, deeper customization, and power-conscious idle behavior.

The goal is simple:

> **Make the desktop move with the music, without making the CPU move mountains to do it.**

## Runs as its own process

Tourne'Table doesn't live inside `explorer.exe`. It runs as its own dedicated process using Windhawk's tool-mod pattern, so you'll see it as its own entry in Task Manager, separate from the shell. Restarting `explorer.exe` doesn't kill it. It just reattaches behind the desktop icons once the shell is back. Requires a Windhawk build with tool-mod support (1.7.3+, including the 2.0 alpha line).

---

## ✧ NEW IN 2.0 (BETA)

This is a test build. It installs alongside the release build and is not for publishing. The performance figures further down were measured on 1.x and haven't been re-measured on 2.0 yet.

**Every bar is its own measurement now.** Up to 1.5 the analysis split the sound into 7 fixed bands and every bar interpolated between those 7 numbers, so Bar Count and FFT Size changed how many bars you saw, not how much they knew. The new **Precision** engine gives each bar its own frequency band with its own edges, measured straight from the spectrum:

- bass comes from long, finely resolved windows and treble from short, fast ones (three resolution tiers), so a 1/24-octave bar at 50 Hz is a real reading rather than a smear;
- band layouts on Log, Linear, Mel, Bark or ERB scales, the standard **IEC 61260** fractional-octave bands every RTA uses, or one bar per **musical note**;
- **A / C / Z weighting** (IEC 61672), a dB-per-octave **tilt**, RMS or peak detection, and a choice of FFT window;
- **ballistics on real time**, so bars move at the same speed at 60, 144 or 240 FPS, with presets for an analyzer, a VU meter and both broadcast PPMs, and gravity peak caps;
- **loudness** (ITU-R BS.1770-5 / EBU R128: momentary, short-term, integrated), 4x-oversampled **true peak**, PLR and stereo **correlation** in the readout, and a new **Goniometer** shape.

The 1.4 analysis is still there as **Analysis Engine = Classic**.

**You choose where the work runs.** **Workload** is GPU, CPU or Hybrid: Hybrid analyses on the CPU and draws on the GPU (the cheapest split almost everywhere), GPU does both on the graphics chip, CPU does both on the processor. NPU stays as an experimental option.

**A new renderer built to cost next to nothing.** **Renderer = Direct3D 11** draws everything from one tiny shader and a buffer of bar heights, **skips any frame where nothing moved**, keeps the text on its own surface that only redraws when the text changes, and tells Windows when the panel is opaque so it copies instead of blending. When audio stops, drawing stops, and after a few more seconds of silence the audio stream itself stops (**Deep Idle**). The 1.5 Direct2D path is still there for comparison.

**Target FPS 0** matches your display's refresh rate, whatever it is.

**Right-click for quick settings.** Shape, colours, analysis, readout, overlays and **which audio device it listens to**, any output, input or virtual device (VB-Audio, Voicemeeter, an Ableton return), all live, without opening Windhawk. Plus a **Terminal** shape (text characters: columns, a waterfall or text meters) and a **media widget** layout: title and artist inside the panel, pixel-sharp text, a track progress bar and media controls pinned to the panel.

**Seven new styles.** LED Meter, Line Spectrum, Polar Bloom, Spectrogram, VU Needles (real IEC VU ballistics), Stereo Field and Particles, all in the Shape list and the right-click menu, plus **Reflection**, a fading mirror under the bars.

**Glow and Bloom.** A soft halo around every bar, worked out in the same shader pass that draws it, and a lens-style bloom from a quarter-size blur that only runs on frames that change. Direct3D 11 renderer.

**A Media Card.** Media Controls > Layout = Card: album art with previous / play / next on hover, a seek bar, one-click output switching and a volume slider. Theme its background, border, corner radius, art size and accent (icon colour, custom, album art or your Windows accent).

**My Styles.** Right-click > My Styles > Style Editor: mix a base style, colours, bar sizes, reflection, glow and bloom while the visualizer previews it live, save it under a name, and pick it from the menu any time.

## ◈ PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE

Measured on an **Intel Core Ultra 265KF** (8 P-cores plus 12 E-cores), running a 120-bar oscilloscope at a 144 FPS target with background blur on, and with media controls, the peak-frequency readout, peak hold and beat flash all enabled.

Every figure below is the **change against an idle baseline**, captured back to back in the same session with the same music playing in both, so what you are reading is the cost of the mod rather than whatever else the machine happened to be doing.

| Metric | Cost of running it |
|:--|--:|
| Total CPU usage | **+1.6 percentage points** *(about 0.3 of one core)* |
| Peak single-thread | **+10.1 points** |
| CPU package power | **+7.2 W** |
| CPU package temperature | **+1.0 °C** |

Medians across 543 samples with it running and 384 without, at 1.25 s intervals. Medians rather than averages because both captures contained brief unrelated background spikes, and a median is not moved by them.

When audio stops, rendering stops, not "slows down," *stops*.

Full methodology, raw traces and caveats live in [the project repo](https://github.com/USER-TOURNE/TOURNE-TABLE) rather than on this page.

## ◆ VISUAL STYLES

### 9 Shapes

| Shape | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| **Stereo** | Classic equalizer bars. Low notes left, high notes right. |
| **Mountain** | Peaks in the middle, tapers toward both edges. |
| **Mirror** | The opposite, grows from the outside edges inward. |
| **Wave** | Normal bars with a slow ripple rolling through them. |
| **Breathe** | A gentle swell that rises with the music instead of jumping. |
| **Dots** | Stacked dots instead of solid bars, old LED-meter look. |
| **Radial** | Bars shoot outward from a center point, like a sunburst. |
| **Oscilloscope** | A single line tracing the actual sound wave. |
| **Goniometer** | The stereo field: every sample plotted with mono straight up and width sideways, with a correlation bar underneath. *(2.0)* |

![Oscilloscope closeup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER-TOURNE/TOURNE-TABLE/main/GIF/8.gif)

*Closeup: the waveform drawn as one continuous line, with the Now Playing label and media buttons alongside.*

### 9 Color Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| **Solid** | One flat color. |
| **Gradient** | Fades between two colors across the bars. |
| **Reactive Gradient** | Shifts toward the second color as things get *louder*. |
| **Windows Accent** | Matches your Windows accent color, updating instantly. |
| **Album Art** | Pulls the dominant color from the playing track's cover. |
| **Dynamic Album** | Gradient between the cover art's two strongest colors. |
| **Acrylic** | Grows more opaque the louder it gets, invisible in silence. |
| **Rainbow Cycle** | Continuously cycling hue, adjustable speed. |
| **Tourne** | Built-in teal → red gradient from my personal palette. |

### Plus

- **2 orientations**: bars grow vertically or horizontally
- **3 anchors**: grow from the Bottom, the Top, or **both directions from the Middle**
- **Peak Hold Caps**: thin markers hang at each bar's recent peak and slowly fall *(classic hardware EQ)*
- **Beat Flash**: bars brighten on detected bass hits, on top of any color mode
- **Multiband Oscilloscope**: the waveform tints toward whichever part of the spectrum is loudest

## ♪ NOW PLAYING DISPLAY

Shows the current **artist and title** above the visualizer, pulled from the same Windows media session that powers your volume popup. Works with Spotify, browsers, and most media players.

Fades in on track change, fades out after a configurable delay. Custom color, font family and size.

*A narrower panel. The trace scales to whatever width the bar settings give it.*

## ◐ THE PALETTE

This project follows my personal theming palette: reflected in the repo screenshots. It can be changed to any hex / RGB / RGBA value you want.

| Name | Hex | RGB |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Green | `#15ffa2` | `21, 255, 162` |
| Red | `#ff8f8f` | `255, 143, 143` |
| Pale Green | `#64aa89` | `100, 170, 137` |
| Alt Pale Green | `#6ba6a0` | `107, 166, 160` |
| Pale Red | `#a95d5d` | `169, 93, 93` |
| Dark Teal *(background)* | `#121c21` | `18, 28, 33` |

The built-in **Tourne** color mode is drawn from these.

---

## ☰ RIGHT-CLICK MENU *(2.0)*

Right-click the visualizer for quick settings, applied the moment you pick them:

- **Audio Source**: the default output (what you hear), the default input, or **any active device by name**, outputs and inputs, virtual ones included. VB-Audio Cable and Matrix, Voicemeeter buses, an Ableton return routed to its own device: if Windows lists it, it's there. Outputs are captured by loopback, inputs recorded directly.
- **Shape**, **Terminal Style**, **Color Mode**, **Analysis Engine**, **Band Layout**, **Weighting**, **Ballistics**, **Readout**, **Workload**, **Renderer**, **Target FPS**.
- Toggles for Peak Hold Caps, Beat Flash, Now Playing, the Track Progress Bar, Media Controls, Pixel-Sharp Text, **Pixel Snap** and **Subpixel Nudges**.
- **Pause Visualizer**, which blanks it and stops the audio stream until you right-click the same spot again (or the media strip) and untick it.
- **Copy Quick Settings** and **Reset Quick Settings**.

Windhawk lets a mod read its settings but not write them, so a menu choice is kept as the mod's own saved value and laid over the settings page. The page keeps showing what's underneath, which is why the menu says how many quick settings are active. **Copy Quick Settings** puts them on the clipboard as `name = value` lines, worded as the menu shows them (for example `Shape = Terminal`, `Peak Hold Caps = On`), so you can make them permanent on the settings page. **Reset Quick Settings** then hands everything back to the page.

The menu only opens where the visualizer is actually showing on the desktop, never through a window that covers it, and a right-click there doesn't open the desktop's own menu. If you'd rather keep a plain right-click for the desktop, set **Right-Click Menu** (Interaction) to **Ctrl + Right-Click**. Right-clicking the media strip opens the same menu.

---

## ◫ SHARP AT EVERY SIZE, OR BETWEEN PIXELS *(2.0)*

**Why it could look soft.** Every size was scaled by your display scaling and every position was a percentage of the screen, both kept as exact fractions. At 125% a 2 px bar is 2.5 px wide, and a Position of 50% can put the visualizer at x = 812.37. A bar that starts or ends partway through a pixel gets an antialiased edge, so some sizes came out crisp and others blurry.

**Pixel Snap** *(Position, on by default)* rounds the position and every scaled size (bar width, gap, max size, panel padding) to whole pixels, so every bar edge, the panel and the text sit exactly on the pixel grid at any size and any scaling. Bar heights stay fractional, which keeps their motion smooth. The process also declares per-monitor DPI awareness on each of its own threads now, so Windows never stretches the picture on a monitor whose scaling differs from your main one.

**Subpixel placement** is Pixel Snap **off**. The picture can then sit between pixels, so it moves by fractions of a pixel, at the cost of slightly soft edges. Physically, a crisp edge and a position between two pixels can't both happen.

- **Keyboard Move Fine Step** *(Interaction)*: 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16 px.
- Hold **Keyboard Move Fine Key** with the move modifier, or tick **Subpixel Nudges** in the right-click menu to make every nudge fine.
- Fine steps move the visualizer. The media strip and the text overlays still move whole pixels, since a window and a text box can't sit between them.
- With Pixel Snap on, fine nudges still add up: four quarter-pixel presses move the picture one pixel.

---

## ▣ THE TERMINAL SHAPE *(2.0)*

**Shape = Terminal** draws the visualizer as text: a grid of characters in a monospace font, in three styles.

- **Columns**: every bar a column of characters (`#` by default) that turns the **Hot Color** above **Hot Threshold**, with the peak cap as a character of its own. The cava / btop look.
- **Waterfall**: a spectrogram in characters. Each line is one moment and each column one band, with the character picked from **Waterfall Ramp** by level and the newest line on top.
- **Meters**: text meters, `Bass:    [######     48%]`, for bass, mid, treble and the loudest band.

It runs on the same per-bar levels as every other shape, so the engine, band layout, weighting and ballistics all apply. With the Direct3D 11 renderer the characters come from a glyph atlas baked once, and the whole grid is one instanced draw: a few hundred cells cost the same as a few hundred bars. Pick a pixel font and **Text Rendering = Pixel** for hard-edged characters.

# ✦ EVERY SETTING, EXPLAINED

**You don't need any of this to use the mod.** The defaults work. This is for when you want to tweak something and you're wondering what a word means.

## Appearance

**Shape**: Which of the 8 styles above to draw.

**Orientation**: *Horizontal* = a row of bars growing up and down. *Vertical* = a column growing left and right.

**Bar Count**: How many bars. More = finer detail, wider visualizer. Range **1-2048** (enough to span a 4K or ultrawide screen).

**Bar Width**: How fat each bar is, in pixels.

**Bar Gap**: Space between bars, in pixels. Set to `0` and they touch.

**Bar Max Size**: How tall a bar gets at full volume. This is the overall height of the visualizer.

**Bar Idle Size**: How tall bars sit in silence. `0` makes them vanish completely; a few pixels leaves a thin resting line.

**Bar Corner Radius**: How rounded the bar corners are. One number rounds all four equally, or give four numbers separated by spaces for individual control: `top-left top-right bottom-right bottom-left`. Example: `5 5 0 0` rounds only the top.

**Color Mode**: Which of the 9 coloring styles above to use.

**Color**: The color used in Solid mode. Format is `#AARRGGBB` or `#RRGGBB`: that's **A**lpha (transparency), then **R**ed, **G**reen, **B**lue in hex. Lower the first two digits to make it see-through.

**Gradient Color 1 / 2**: Start and end colors for the gradient modes.

**Sensitivity**: How hard the bars react. Too low and quiet music barely moves them; too high and everything slams to max. Range 0-300. Turn it down for bass-heavy tracks, up for quiet recordings.

**Input Gain (dB)**: A fixed level trim on the captured audio, applied before everything else. Range -24 to +24, default 0.

> **Why this exists.** Loopback capture sees the mix *after* each app's own volume slider but *before* the Windows master slider. So if you keep Spotify at 40% and the system at 80%, the visualizer only ever sees that 40%, and turning the system up does not help it. Input Gain is the control that does. It is also the only setting that scales the **Oscilloscope** waveform directly, which otherwise has no level control of its own. Auto Gain scales the trace too when it is on, and the trace clips flat rather than running off the panel.
>
> **It moves the idle thresholds with it.** Pause When Silent and Auto-Hide When Idle both key off how far the bars are moving, so raising Input Gain lowers the level that counts as silence, and lowering it raises that level. Sensitivity has always behaved the same way for the same reason. If you push Input Gain a long way up, expect the mod to consider quieter things "playing".

**Auto Gain**: Adapts the level continuously so quiet sources still fill the bars, instead of retuning Sensitivity per app or per track. Off by default.

It only ever boosts, never cuts, so loud material behaves exactly as it does with this off. Through silence it holds its last value rather than winding up, which means the noise floor is never lifted and **idle shutdown still works normally**. The idle test reads the un-boosted level against the same threshold it always used, so turning Auto Gain on neither extends nor shortens how long the mod stays awake.

Two things it does affect, worth knowing before you go hunting for them:

- Because it normalizes the loudest band to a fixed target, **Sensitivity stops doing much for quiet material** while it is on. That is inherent to how a levelling gain works, not a bug.
- On the **Oscilloscope**, a lower Sensitivity produces a *larger* trace, since a smaller measured peak asks for a bigger boost.

**Auto Gain Max Boost (dB)**: The ceiling on that lift. Range 0-24, default 12. Lower it if quiet passages are being flattened more than you want, raise it if a very quiet source still will not fill the bars.

**EQ Preset**: Which frequencies get emphasized *visually*. Doesn't touch your actual audio.
`Default` no adjustment · `Bass` boosts lows · `Rock` boosts mids and highs · `Pop` heavy on highs · `Jazz` warmer, gentler highs · `Electronic` boosts bass and treble, scoops the middle.

**FFT Size**: How finely sound gets analyzed. An FFT is the math that splits audio into separate frequencies: think of it as sorting sound into buckets by pitch. More buckets = finer detail, slightly more CPU.
`1024` fastest, plenty for most · `2048` / `4096` noticeably crisper · `8192` maximum detail.

> **With the Precision engine (2.0)** this is the size of each of the three resolution tiers, and bass detail comes from the tiers rather than from raising this. `2048` *(the new default)* is the sweet spot. Sensitivity no longer has to be retuned per FFT Size either: levels are calibrated in dBFS, so a change of FFT Size changes resolution, not height.

> **The Oscilloscope no longer cares what this is set to.** It used to take its trace over a window of exactly one FFT block, so raising FFT Size stretched the trace to cover more time and updated it less often, which is why `8192` used to look so rough on that shape. The trace now runs on its own time base, set by **Oscilloscope Time Window** below. Pick FFT Size for the bars and leave the scope out of it.
>
> **One more note:** the higher the FFT Size, the more accurate the Sensitivity slider becomes for your specific audio setup. The correlation generally runs: **as FFT Size goes up, your Sensitivity will need to go up too.** For now that means fine-tuning Sensitivity per EQ Preset *and* per FFT Size, for your particular placement, size and personal adjustments.

**Frequency Scale**: How the frequency range spreads across the bars (with Band Layout = Frequency Scale). This matters more than it sounds.
- **Log**: the natural-feeling default. Gives bass and treble roughly equal visual space, matching how humans hear pitch.
- **Linear**: spreads by raw Hz. Since most musical energy lives low, this crams all the action into a sliver on the left and leaves the right mostly dead. Technically accurate, visually dull.
- **Mel**: uses the *mel scale*, built from research on how people actually perceive pitch. Like Log, tuned to human hearing.
- **Bark**: the ear's critical bands (Traunmueller's formula): more room for the midrange, where hearing is most finely tuned.
- **ERB**: equivalent rectangular bandwidths (Glasberg and Moore), the widths of the ear's own auditory filters. Between Log and Bark.

**Peak Frequency Readout**: Shows the loudest note as a live number, e.g. `1.2 kHz`, or loudness figures instead (see **Readout Content** under Analysis).

**Peak Readout Position**: Where that number sits. Horizontal: Left / Center / Right. Vertical: Above / Top / Middle / Bottom / Below.
> **Above** and **Below** place it fully *outside* the bars so it never overlaps the visualization.

**Multiband Oscilloscope Coloring**: Only affects the Oscilloscope shape. The line tints toward whatever part of the spectrum is loudest: warm for bass, green for mids, blue for treble. Overrides Color Mode for that shape.

**Oscilloscope Time Window (ms)**: How much audio the trace shows end to end. Range 5-250, default `24`.

> This is the scope's time base, and it is the setting that decides what the trace *looks* like. Small values stretch out individual wave cycles, so a bass note reads as a few big smooth curves. Large values pack more of the signal into the same width, so it reads as a rolling envelope. Around `20-30` is the hardware-scope look; **`150-180` is close to what FFT Size `8192` used to give**.
>
> It is deliberately independent of **FFT Size**. The trace is sampled on its own clock at roughly 100 updates a second whatever the FFT is doing, peak-sampled rather than point-sampled so it neither aliases nor loses amplitude as the window widens, and aligned to a rising zero crossing so the waveform holds still instead of sliding sideways.

**Oscilloscope Damping**: Slows how fast the trace changes *shape*, without slowing how often it is *drawn*. Range 0-100, default `0`.

> These are two different things and the distinction is the whole point. The trace is still redrawn every frame at your Target FPS, so nothing gets choppier. What damping changes is how far each point is allowed to move per frame, so the waveform evolves slowly enough to follow with your eyes instead of being a new picture every frame.
>
> This is what makes a wide **Time Window** legible rather than busy. On its own a 170 ms window is a lot of information changing fast; damped, it becomes a shape you can actually track. Try `150` window with `60-80` damping.
>
> It costs nothing. The easing is a single multiply per point on the render thread, and it does not touch the capture path or the frame rate.

**Anchor**: Which edge bars grow from. `Bottom` rise upward *(classic)* · `Top` hang downward · `Middle` grow **both directions** from a center line.

**Peak Hold Caps**: Leaves a thin marker floating at each bar's recent peak, which slowly drifts down.

**Beat Flash** + **Intensity**: Flashes bars brighter on bass hits. Intensity controls how hard.

**Rainbow Cycle Speed**: How fast the rainbow rotates. Rainbow mode only.

**Now Playing Text**: Toggles the artist/title display.

**Now Playing Color / Font / Font Size**: Styling for that text. The font must be **installed on your system**: type the exact family name. Windows silently falls back to a default on a typo rather than erroring, so double-check spelling if nothing changes.
> The Peak Frequency Readout shares these same font settings.

**Now Playing Display Seconds**: How long the text stays up after a track change before fading.

## Analysis (Precision Engine)

Everything here applies to **Analysis Engine = Precision**, the default. With **Classic** the bars come from the 1.4 analysis and these settings are ignored.

**Analysis Engine**: **Precision** gives every bar its own frequency band, measured from the spectrum. **Classic** is the 1.4 analysis: 7 fixed bands the bars interpolate between. Kept for comparison, and because some people will prefer its looser look.

**Band Layout**: How the spectrum is cut into bars.
- **Frequency Scale** *(default)*: **Bar Count** bars spread from Min to Max Frequency on the **Frequency Scale** set under Appearance.
- **IEC 61260**: the standard fractional-octave bands (base-10, centred on 1 kHz) that every real-time analyzer uses. **Octave Fraction** picks the width.
- **Musical**: one bar per note of equal temperament (or per quarter tone), tuned to **Tuning (A4)**.

IEC and Musical decide how many bars there are, so **Bar Count** is ignored for them: 1/3 octave from 20 Hz to 20 kHz is 31 bars, 1/6 is 60, 1/12 is 120 and 1/24 is 240.

**Octave Fraction**: 1/1, 1/3, 1/6, 1/12 or 1/24 octave. 1/3 is the classic RTA; 1/12 is a semitone. Musical only uses 1/12 and 1/24.

**Min / Max Frequency**: The analysed range. Max is capped at 21 kHz, below the Nyquist limit of every common output device.

**Tuning (A4)**: Reference pitch for Musical, 400 to 480 Hz.

**Weighting**: **Z** is flat. **A** follows the ear at quiet listening levels and pulls the bass right down; **C** is the gentler loud-level curve. Both from IEC 61672-1, added per band, free.

**Tilt (dB per octave)**: A slope around 1 kHz.

> **What 0 means here.** Bars are measured as band power and, by default, referenced to a 1/3-octave band (see Level Reference), so **pink noise already reads flat at 0**, the way it does on a hardware RTA. Most music falls a little faster than pink. **1.5** *(default)* makes a typical modern mix read level, the same thing SPAN's 4.5 dB/oct default does on a plain FFT display (an FFT display needs 3 dB/oct just to flatten pink noise; this one doesn't).

**Detector**: **RMS** sums the power of every frequency in the band, the right reading for music and noise. **Peak** shows the band's loudest single frequency, closer to what a tone reads on a meter.

**Level Reference**: **Third-octave** *(default)* scales every band to the power a 1/3-octave band at the same centre would hold. Changing Bar Count or Band Layout then changes how fine the bars are, not how tall. **Band** shows each band's true power, so wide bars read higher than narrow ones.

**FFT Window**: **Hann** is the general-purpose choice. **Blackman-Harris** has 92 dB of dynamic range, so quiet detail next to a loud tone stays visible. **Flat-top** reads a tone's exact level wherever it falls between bins, at the cost of resolution. **Hamming** has a narrower peak and more leakage.

**Bass Detail**: The resolution tiers. The audio is analysed as captured, decimated by 4, and decimated by 16, each with the same FFT size, and each bar is measured from the fastest tier that can resolve it. **High** *(default)* uses all three, which is what makes fine bass bars real; **Standard** stops at 4; **Off** is a single FFT.

> **Why tiers instead of a bigger FFT.** Bin spacing is sample rate over FFT size, 23 Hz at 48 kHz and 2048. A 1/24-octave band at 50 Hz is 1.4 Hz wide, so one FFT would need to be enormous to resolve it, and an enormous FFT reacts slowly everywhere, treble included. Decimating first gives the bass a long window and the treble a short one. At FFT Size 2048 the three windows are 43, 171 and 683 ms long, and the two deeper tiers are only re-analysed when enough new audio has arrived to make it worthwhile.

**Channel**: Which signal the spectrum comes from. **Mix** averages all channels, as before. **Mid** is what both speakers share; **Side** is their difference, which shows exactly where a mix's stereo width lives.

**Display Floor / Ceiling (dBFS)**: The levels that draw as an empty and a full bar, before Sensitivity. A full-scale sine is 0 dBFS; loud modern music sits around -20 dBFS per third-octave band. Defaults -72 and -12.

> **Sensitivity** still works with Precision, as a gain: each step from the default 150 is 0.2 dB, so the slider covers -30 to +30 dB. **Sensitivity Curve** still shapes the top of the range, **Auto Gain** lifts quiet sources toward 85% of the range (boost only, held through silence), **EQ Preset** becomes a dB gain on the low, mid and high zones, and **Motion Smoothing** slows whichever Ballistics you pick, up to 6x.

**Ballistics**: How bars rise and fall. All of them run on elapsed time, so the motion is the same at any frame rate.
- **Snappy** *(default)*: closest to the 1.4 feel.
- **Smooth**: slower, easier to follow.
- **Analyzer**: falls a steady 20 dB per second, like a hardware RTA.
- **VU**: 300 ms integration.
- **PPM, EBU (Type II)** and **PPM, DIN (Type I)**: the IEC 60268-10 return rates (24 dB in 2.8 s, 20 dB in 1.5 s).
- **Custom**: **Custom Attack (ms)** and **Custom Release (dB/s)**.

**Peak Hold Time / Peak Fall**: With **Peak Hold Caps** on, how long a cap hangs, then whether it falls with **Gravity** (accelerating, the classic analyzer look) or at a steady **Linear** rate.

**Readout Content**: What the readout set up under **Peak Frequency Readout** shows.
- **Peak frequency**: as before.
- **Loudness**: **M**omentary (400 ms), **S**hort-term (3 s) and gated **I**ntegrated loudness in LUFS, per ITU-R BS.1770-5 and EBU R128.
- **Loudness, true peak, PLR, correlation**: adds 4x-oversampled true peak (dBTP), PLR (true peak minus integrated loudness) and stereo correlation (+1 mono, 0 wide, -1 out of phase).
- **Both**: peak frequency and loudness.

The loudness meters only run while they are on screen.

**Reset Integrated Loudness On Track Change**: Starts a new integrated measurement with each track, so the figure is per track.

> **What loopback can't see.** The mod hears what Windows mixes, after each app's own volume slider and before the master slider. Players in **WASAPI exclusive** or **ASIO** mode bypass that mix entirely, so the visualizer shows nothing while they play, and loudness figures describe the mix, not the file.

## Position

**Horizontal Position**: Left-to-right placement as a percentage. `0` hard left, `50` centered, `100` hard right.

**Vertical Position**: Top-to-bottom, same idea. `0` top, `100` bottom.

**Monitor**: Which screen to draw on. `1` is your first monitor.

## Background

**Enabled**: Draws a panel behind the bars. Turn off for bars floating directly on the wallpaper.

**Color**: Panel color in `#AARRGGBB`. The alpha controls transparency.

**Padding**: Breathing room between the bars and the panel edge.

**Corner Radius**: How rounded the panel corners are. Same one-or-four-value rules as bar radius.

**Blur**: Frosted-glass blur of your wallpaper behind the panel. `0` disables.
> This used to be the single most expensive setting in the mod. It's now computed once and cached, so it's essentially free per frame.

**Border Size / Border Color**: A thin outline around the panel. `0` for none.

## Performance

**Target FPS**: How many times per second it redraws. Higher = smoother, more CPU. Little point exceeding your monitor's refresh rate. **`0` matches the refresh rate**, whatever it is. With the Direct3D 11 renderer a frame where nothing moved is skipped entirely, so a high target costs far less than it used to in quiet or steady passages.

**Pause On Fullscreen**: Stops completely when a fullscreen app runs. Detects both true fullscreen *(games)* and borderless windows. Since the visualizer lives on the desktop it's invisible anyway. This just stops it burning power. Resumes automatically.

**Pause When Silent (seconds)**: After this long without audio, drops to a trickle instead of full speed: it wakes only when audio arrives or four times a second, and with Direct3D 11 presents nothing unless something changes. `0` disables (and Deep Idle with it).

**Deep Idle** *(2.0)*: Five seconds after Pause When Silent kicks in, stops the audio stream itself and reads Windows' own peak meter four times a second instead, restarting the moment anything plays. A running capture stream registers an audio power request, which can keep the PC from sleeping (`powercfg /requests` shows it); a stopped one doesn't. On by default.

**Auto-Hide When Idle** + **Delay**: Fades out entirely after prolonged silence. Once fully faded it **stops rendering completely**, not just invisible, genuinely doing nothing until audio returns.

**Pause When Covered**: Stops rendering *and* audio capture while fully hidden behind another window.
> **Off by default.** Reliably detecting "am I covered?" on Windows 11 is genuinely tricky: the shell is full of invisible windows that report themselves as visible. The check is deliberately conservative (only a fully-covering, real application window counts), but if the visualizer ever vanishes when it shouldn't, this is the switch to flip.

## Hardware

There are two jobs in this mod, and they can run on different silicon: **analysing** the audio (the FFTs that turn sound into frequency bands) and **drawing** the result.

**Workload**: Where the work runs.
- **Hybrid** *(default)*: analysis on the CPU, drawing on the GPU. Analysis is a fraction of a percent of one core, and the GPU draws for almost nothing, so this is the cheapest split on nearly every PC.
- **GPU**: the analysis runs on the graphics chip as well, in four small compute passes that feed the drawing directly, so the CPU only copies audio and nothing comes back each frame but 8 bytes of statistics. Needs the Precision engine and the Direct3D 11 renderer, and uses at most FFT Size 4096. Worth trying on a strong iGPU; measure it against Hybrid rather than assume.
- **CPU**: analysis and drawing both on the processor (drawing in software, through WARP). The GPU is left with nothing but Windows' own compositing. Fine for a small widget; a full-width strip at a high frame rate is real CPU work.
- **NPU** *(experimental)*: the FFTs run on an Intel AI Boost NPU, drawing on the GPU. See the NPU section below for why this rarely saves anything.

**Drawing Device**: Which GPU draws.
- **Auto** *(default)*: the GPU your chosen monitor is plugged into. On a laptop with two GPUs, or a desktop with the iGPU left on, drawing on the *other* one means every frame gets copied across to the GPU that scans it out, which is exactly the kind of uneven frame time this mod is trying to avoid. Auto asks Windows which GPU owns that screen and uses it, and follows if the answer changes.
- **Integrated GPU**: the power-saving GPU, the same one Windows picks for "Power saving" in Graphics settings. Falls back to Auto, with a warning, if there isn't one (F and KF processors have no iGPU, and desktops often switch it off in the BIOS).
- **Discrete GPU**: the high-performance GPU. Same fallback.
- **CPU**: software rendering, the same as Workload = CPU.

If the GPU is ever lost mid-session (a driver update, a driver reset, a laptop switching GPUs), the mod rebuilds itself on whatever is available instead of freezing until restart.

**Renderer**:
- **Direct3D 11** *(default)*: every bar, dot, cap, spoke and scope segment is one instanced quad from a tiny vertex shader that reads the bar heights straight from a buffer. The CPU writes two numbers per bar and issues a handful of draw calls per frame, whatever the bar count, and the pixel shader computes exact antialiased edges, so shapes look like Direct2D's. On top of that:
  - **Frames where nothing moved are skipped.** The picture is summarised in a hash (bar heights to a quarter pixel, colours, the trace) and compared with the last frame shown. If it matches, nothing is drawn and nothing is presented, so Windows has nothing to recompose.
  - **The text lives on its own surface**, redrawn only when the text or its fade changes. The animated surface covers just the panel, not the room reserved around it for text.
  - **The panel can be opaque** (see Opaque Panel).
- **Direct2D**: the 1.5 path, unchanged, including Smooth Mode's batching. Kept for comparison, and used automatically, with a warning, if Direct3D 11 can't start (a GPU below feature level 11.0, or `d3dcompiler_47.dll` missing).

**Opaque Panel**: When the background panel can't show anything behind it (**Blur** on, or a panel colour with full alpha) and **Auto-Hide** is off, the Direct3D 11 renderer creates the panel's surface with alpha ignored and lets the compositor cut the rounded corners. Windows then copies those pixels instead of blending them every frame; Chromium measured the same switch at 3.12 W against 2.28 W. **Off** always blends, for comparison.

**NPU Runtime Folder**: Where Intel's OpenVINO runtime lives. Blank searches the usual places. Only read when Workload is NPU.

**Smooth Mode**: Frame timing locked to the display, and motion on elapsed time. **Auto** *(default)* turns it on when drawing runs on an integrated GPU or the CPU; **On** works on any GPU and is worth trying on a discrete one too; **Off** is the 1.4 timing. What it changes:

- **Frame timing locked to the display.** The 1.4 loop asks for a frame every `1000 / Target FPS` milliseconds and lets the timer's wake-up latency pile up, which is why 144 requested measured 141.7 delivered. On a 144 Hz panel that is a couple of refreshes every second with no new frame: a repeat, which you see as a hitch. Smooth Mode schedules from Windows' own composition clock instead, places every frame half a refresh away from the deadline on either side, and never accumulates drift.
- **Target FPS rounded to an even fraction of the refresh rate.** 60 FPS on a 144 Hz screen means frames held for 2, 3, 2, 3 refreshes, which reads as judder however precise the timer is. Smooth Mode runs the nearest whole fraction instead: 60 becomes 72 on 144 Hz, 48 if you set it to 50, 60 on a 60 Hz screen. Asking for more than the refresh rate gets the refresh rate rather than frames nobody can see.
- **Motion that doesn't depend on frame timing.** With the Classic engine, bar rise and fall, peak caps, beat flash and scope damping were all "move this fraction per frame", so a late frame visibly slowed everything down for a moment. They now scale by how much time actually passed. (The Precision engine runs on elapsed time whatever this is set to.)
- **A proper animation clock.** Wave, Breathe and Rainbow ran off a millisecond counter that only ticks every 15.6 ms, stored in a float that loses precision the longer the PC has been on. They now run off the high-resolution clock. (Always, with the Direct3D 11 renderer.)
- **With the Direct2D renderer:** the background baked once into one image, all bars in one sprite batch, and cached text layouts.

# ◇ RUNNING THE ANALYSIS ON AN NPU (EXPERIMENTAL)

Written against an **Alienware Aurora ACT1250** (the 2025 Aurora: Core Ultra 7 265K / 265KF or Ultra 9 285K, RTX 50-series), but it applies to any Intel Core Ultra machine.

**Read this first: it almost certainly won't save power.** An NPU is a matrix-multiply engine. It wins when the work is a large, dense block of multiply-accumulates that runs continuously, like a neural network. An FFT is neither: to run on the NPU it has to be rewritten as matrix multiplies, which is roughly 25 times more arithmetic than an FFT, and every call has a fixed start-up cost the FFT is far too small to pay back. Calling it once per frame also keeps the NPU from power-gating between calls. Meanwhile the CPU does the whole analysis in well under 1% of one core. More bars don't change that: with the Precision engine every bar adds up its own bins once per frame, so 240 bars cost the same as 7.

It stays as an option because the plumbing is the hard, reusable part (finding the runtime, compiling off the audio path, proving the result against a known answer, falling back to the CPU with a reason), and because the NPU's real use in a visualizer is still to come: neural models such as note transcription (a piano-roll mode, note names on musical bars) or stem separation (colour each bar by whether drums, bass or vocals drive it). Those are dense, continuous matrix work, which is what an NPU is for.

**What's in there.** Arrow Lake desktop chips carry Intel's NPU 3, sold as *Intel AI Boost*: about 13 TOPS, the same generation as Meteor Lake, and present on K, KF and F models alike (the F only drops the iGPU). It is a separate block from both the CPU cores and the GPU, built for large batches of multiply-accumulates in low precision (FP16 / INT8).

**Making sure it's on.**
1. Device Manager should have a **Neural processors** category with **Intel(R) AI Boost** under it. Task Manager on Windows 11 24H2 and later also shows an **NPU** graph on the Performance tab.
2. If it's missing, install the **Intel NPU driver** (from Dell's support page for the Aurora, or Intel's own "Intel NPU Driver - Windows" download). It needs Windows 11.
3. Still missing after that: check the BIOS for an NPU / AI Boost switch. Some Arrow Lake firmware ships one, and Intel's own guidance for Windows 10 machines is to turn the NPU off there.

**Giving this mod a way to talk to it.** Intel exposes the NPU through its **OpenVINO** runtime, which this mod loads at runtime if it's present. Nothing is bundled and nothing is installed for you. Any of these works:
- Download the OpenVINO archive for Windows from Intel and extract it (to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_<version>` is the conventional spot, which the mod searches on its own), or
- `pip install openvino` into a Python install (the mod searches the usual Python locations too), or
- put the folder holding `openvino_c.dll` into **NPU Runtime Folder**.

Use an OpenVINO version at least as new as the one your NPU driver's release notes name. Then set **Workload** to **NPU**. The Windhawk log says what happened: which runtime and device it found, how long the model took to compile, and every 30 seconds the mean and worst NPU time per FFT. If anything is missing, the settings-problems window says which piece and what to do, and the analysis stays on the CPU in the meantime.

> **64-bit only.** OpenVINO ships 64-bit builds only. Windhawk 1.x runs tool mods in a 32-bit process, so there the NPU option reports that and stays on the CPU.

**How it works.** The FFT is rewritten as matrix multiplies (a "four-step" DFT: a DFT down the columns, a twiddle multiply, a DFT along the rows). The model is generated in memory for your FFT Size, compiled for the NPU once, and checked against a known answer before it's trusted. Its output feeds exactly the same band maths as the CPU path, for either engine, so the bars look identical. Measure it with HWiNFO against Hybrid, the same way the CPU figures above were measured, and keep whichever costs less.

# ▲ WHERE THE EFFICIENCY COMES FROM

In rough order of measured impact.

### 1. Precision frame pacing: the biggest single win

The obvious way to pace a desktop widget is `DwmFlush()`, which blocks until the monitor's next refresh. That wakes the render thread **on every vertical blank, forever** (60, 144, 240+ times a second) regardless of the target FPS, whether anything needs redrawing, or whether the visualizer is even visible.

This barely registers as CPU% in Task Manager, because the thread is blocked, not spinning. But every wake-up drags a core out of deep idle. Do that continuously and the core never settles into its efficient sleep states, which reads as a small, permanent bump in package power and temperature. The classic "low usage, still runs warm" signature.

> **Note:** this becomes exponentially more noticeable on AMD architecture.
>
> **Note:** also exponentially more noticeable if you have **C-States disabled** in your BIOS or elsewhere. Shoutout to Process Lasso, Core Director, Park Control and HWiNFO64 for helping me work out why all my E-cores were sitting at 65-70 °C when they were supposed to be idle.

**Instead:** a high-resolution waitable timer firing only at the configured rate. Plain `Sleep()` isn't good enough. It's quantized to ~15.6 ms, which would turn a 60 FPS target into stuttery 30-40 FPS.

### 2. Pre-rendered background blur

A Gaussian blur is a full-image convolution: the most expensive thing Direct2D does in this scene. Recomputing it every frame is pure waste, because its input (your wallpaper) never changes.

**Instead:** it is computed exactly once into a cached bitmap, and each frame just copies that. The cache covers only the widget's bounding box, which is **tens of KB of video memory rather than several MB**. It re-bakes automatically if the widget moves or resizes.

### 3. Widget-sized render surface

The visualizer occupies a thin strip, so a desktop-spanning render surface would clear and present millions of untouched pixels every frame, and park two full-desktop buffers in VRAM.

**Instead:** the surface is sized to the widget's bounding box, and the composition layer is offset to position it. That is roughly an order of magnitude less per-frame pixel work and VRAM.

### 4. Cached geometry

Building the background panel and border means allocating a path geometry and constructing four lines and four arcs by hand. It is rebuilt only when size, padding, radii or border width actually change (in normal use, almost never) rather than every frame.

### 5. Cached monitor lookup

`EnumDisplayMonitors()` is a real round-trip through the display driver stack. The monitor is resolved once and cached, refreshed on display change, instead of being looked up per frame.

### 6. Reduced frame latency

DXGI queues up to three frames ahead by default. For a passive widget that's pure latency and power draw with no upside. Capped at **1**.

### 7. Genuine idle shutdown

**Auto-Hide** now stops rendering completely once faded: presents one blank frame, then exits the render path entirely. **Pause When Covered** stops rendering and capture while hidden, checked once per second rather than per frame.

### 8. One wake per frame, for audio and video together *(2.0)*

1.5 woke two threads to get audio onto the screen: a capture thread on every WASAPI packet (about 100 times a second while anything played) and a pacing thread once per frame. 2.0 merges them: once per frame, one thread drains whatever audio has arrived, analyses it and hands the frame over. At 60 FPS that is roughly 100 fewer wake-ups a second.

### 9. Frames that didn't change are never presented *(2.0, Direct3D 11 renderer)*

Every present hands Windows' compositor a new buffer and wakes it to blend that rectangle again, even when the pixels are identical. The renderer now compares a summary of the frame with the last one shown and skips both the draw and the present when nothing moved by a quarter of a pixel. During sustained notes, quiet passages and every idle state, that is most frames, and a compositor with nothing to do goes back to sleep.

### 10. Three steps of idle *(2.0)*

- **Playing**: one wake per frame.
- **Silent** (after Pause When Silent): wakes only when audio arrives or four times a second, and presents nothing unless something changes.
- **Deep Idle** (five seconds later): the loopback stream itself is stopped, and Windows' own peak meter is read four times a second instead. A running capture stream registers an audio power request, which can hold the PC out of sleep (check `powercfg /requests`); a stopped one doesn't. The engine thread also asks Windows for efficiency-core scheduling (EcoQoS) while idle, and opts out of it while playing so frame pacing stays tight.

### 11. Less for the compositor to blend *(2.0, Direct3D 11 renderer)*

The animated surface covers only the panel; the text has a surface of its own that only changes when the text does. And when the panel is opaque (Blur on, or a solid colour), Windows is told so, and copies those pixels instead of blending them.

# ▦ ON THE NUMBERS

The figures above come from HWiNFO64 sensor logging: two captures taken back to back in one session, one with the mod running and one with it disabled, with the same music playing throughout both so the only thing that changed was the mod itself. 543 samples running, 384 disabled, at 1.25 s intervals.

The full write-up (raw tables, the method, run-to-run variance, and an honest account of where the measurements fall short) is in [the project repo](https://github.com/USER-TOURNE/TOURNE-TABLE). It does not belong on a catalog page, so it is not reproduced here.

The caveats worth stating up front: **HWiNFO measures the whole machine, not this process alone.** A number quoted as the mod's cost therefore includes the work the mod causes elsewhere, in the compositor and the graphics driver, not only the time spent in its own threads. That makes it larger than a per-process trace would show, and it is the honest figure to quote, because it is what the machine actually pays. Both captures also contained short unrelated background spikes, which is why the numbers above are medians rather than averages.

### A coincidence worth acknowledging

While I was midway through my initial testing, **NeiZ** (author/maintainer, with **SuperSmile123** contributing) released [Desktop Audio Visualizer Plus](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk-mods/commit/e01d0d0dbd6204804235831fd7f68821e4614028) (`neiz-supersmile-audio-visualizer`). I had planned to publish my own commit that same night: holy coincidence.

His release spurred another round of testing on my end, and I've since gone through roughly twelve more iterations. I didn't want to ship something that essentially achieved what I was already going for, especially if they'd figuratively led me out to pasture to put a bullet in me: aha.

      $description: One value for all corners, or four space-separated values for top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left
    - colorMode: solid
      $name: Color Mode
      $description: How bars are colored. See the Color, Gradient Color 1/2 and Rainbow Cycle Speed settings below for the modes that use them
      $options:
        - solid: Solid
        - gradient: Gradient
        - reactive_gradient: Reactive Gradient
        - accent: Windows Accent Color

      $name: Color
      $description: 'Used when Color Mode is Solid. Format is #AARRGGBB, #RRGGBB, rgba(r, g, b, a), or rgb(r, g, b)'
    - gradientColor1: '#FF1ED760'
      $name: Gradient Color 1
      $description: 'Start color for Gradient and Reactive Gradient modes. Format is #AARRGGBB, #RRGGBB, rgba(r, g, b, a), or rgb(r, g, b)'

    - sensitivity: 150
      $name: Sensitivity
      $description: How hard the bars react to audio. Range 0-300. Past a point, raising this mostly makes quiet passages louder rather than making loud passages hit any harder, since loud signal is already at max bar height, see Sensitivity Curve
    - sensitivityCurve: knee
      $name: Sensitivity Curve
      $description: How the top of the Sensitivity range is handled once a band's signal would otherwise overshoot max bar height. Exponential is smoothest but softens loud hits earliest; Knee keeps quiet-to-moderate signal untouched and only compresses the loud end; Power is the cheapest and gives the most headroom before compressing
      $options:
        - exponential: Exponential (Soft)
        - knee: Knee (Balanced)
        - power: Power (Headroom)
    - inputGain: 0
      $name: Input Gain (dB)
      $description: A fixed level adjustment applied to the captured audio before anything else. Range -24 to +24, where 0 leaves the signal exactly as captured. Loopback capture sees each app's own volume slider but not the Windows master slider, so a music app sitting at 40% reads as quiet no matter how loud the system sounds. This is the control for that. Unlike Sensitivity it also scales the Oscilloscope waveform
    - autoGain: false
      $name: Auto Gain
      $description: Continuously adapts the level so quiet sources still fill the bars, without retuning Sensitivity per app or per track. Boost only, so loud material behaves exactly as it does with this off. Held steady through silence, which means the noise floor is never lifted and idle shutdown still works normally
    - autoGainMaxBoost: 12
      $name: Auto Gain Max Boost (dB)
      $description: The ceiling on how far Auto Gain may lift a quiet signal. Range 0 to 24. Lower it if quiet passages are getting flattened more than you want, raise it if a very quiet source still will not fill the bars. Only used when Auto Gain is on
    - smoothing: 0
      $name: Motion Smoothing
      $description: Slows down how quickly bars rise and fall toward the target level, at the cost of a bit of lag. 0 is the original snappy response; higher values trade responsiveness for a steadier, easier-to-read motion -- helpful when bars are small on the desktop and fast jitter is hard to track
    - eqPreset: default
      $name: EQ Preset
      $description: Reshapes how much each frequency range (bass/mid/treble) is boosted, tuned per genre
      $options:
        - default: Default
        - bass: Bass
        - rock: Rock
        - pop: Pop
        - jazz: Jazz
        - electronic: Electronic
    - fftSize: '2048'
      $name: FFT Size
      $description: Higher values give finer frequency detail at a small extra CPU cost. With the Precision engine this is the size of each of its three resolution tiers, so bass detail comes from the tiers rather than from raising this; 2048 is the sweet spot. Workload GPU uses at most 4096
      $options:
        - '1024': 1024 (Fastest)
        - '2048': '2048'
        - '4096': '4096'

    - oscilloscopeMultibandEnabled: false
      $name: Multiband Oscilloscope Coloring
      $description: Tints the Oscilloscope trace by which part of the spectrum (low/mid/high) is currently dominant, overriding Color Mode for that shape
    - oscilloscopeWindowMs: 24
      $name: Oscilloscope Time Window (ms)
      $description: How much audio the trace shows end to end, in milliseconds. Range 5 to 250. Low values stretch out individual wave cycles and look like a hardware scope; high values compress more of the signal into the same width and read as a rolling envelope. This is a real time base, independent of FFT Size, so changing frequency resolution no longer changes what the trace looks like. Around 150 to 180 is close to what FFT Size 8192 used to give. Only affects the Oscilloscope shape
    - oscilloscopeDamping: 0
      $name: Oscilloscope Damping
      $description: Slows how fast the trace changes shape, without slowing how often it is drawn. Range 0 to 100. 0 is the raw trace, redrawn every frame. Higher values ease each point toward its new position so the waveform moves slowly enough to follow with your eyes, which is what makes a wide time window legible rather than busy. Pair it with a high Time Window. Costs nothing and does not change your frame rate. Only affects the Oscilloscope shape
    - verticalAnchor: bottom
      $name: Anchor
      $description: Where bars grow from
      $options:
        - top: Top

    - nowPlayingOffsetX: 0
      $name: Now Playing Offset X
      $description: Shifts the artist/title text sideways from where it normally sits, in pixels. Negative moves it left, positive right. It still travels with the visualizer -- this only changes where it sits relative to it, which is how you move it clear of the background panel. Can also be nudged live with the keyboard (Interaction, move target 2). A keyboard nudge ADDS to this number rather than replacing it, so whatever you type here always counts
    - nowPlayingOffsetY: 0
      $name: Now Playing Offset Y

      $name: Peak Readout Offset X
      $description: Shifts the frequency readout sideways from its chosen alignment, in pixels. Negative moves it left, positive right. Use this for fine placement -- the alignment options above put it in the right general area, this puts it exactly where you want it. Can also be nudged live with the keyboard (Interaction, move target 3), which adds to this number rather than replacing it

- analysis:
    - engine: precision
      $name: Analysis Engine
      $description: Precision gives every bar its own frequency band, measured straight from the spectrum, with bass from long high-resolution windows and treble from short fast ones. Classic is the 1.4 analysis, 7 bands that the bars interpolate between, kept for comparison and for anyone who prefers its look. Everything else in this section only applies to Precision
      $options:
        - precision: Precision (every bar its own band)
        - classic: Classic (1.4, 7 bands)
    - bandLayout: scale
      $name: Band Layout
      $description: How the spectrum is cut into bars. Frequency Scale spreads Bar Count bars across Min to Max Frequency on the Frequency Scale chosen above. IEC 61260 uses the standard fractional-octave bands every RTA uses (Octave Fraction picks 1/1 to 1/24), and Musical gives one bar per note of equal temperament. Both of those decide the number of bars themselves, so Bar Count is ignored for them
      $options:
        - scale: Frequency Scale (uses Bar Count)
        - iec: IEC 61260 fractional-octave bands
        - musical: Musical notes (equal temperament)
    - octaveFraction: '6'
      $name: Octave Fraction
      $description: Bandwidth for the IEC 61260 and Musical layouts. 1/3 is the classic RTA; 1/12 is one bar per semitone; 1/24 is a quarter tone, about 240 bars from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Musical only offers 1/12 and 1/24; anything coarser counts as 1/12 there
      $options:
        - '1': 1/1 octave
        - '3': 1/3 octave
        - '6': 1/6 octave
        - '12': 1/12 octave (semitone)

    - weighting: z
      $name: Weighting
      $description: Frequency weighting from IEC 61672-1, added per band. Z is flat, the honest view of the signal. A follows the ear's sensitivity at quiet listening levels and pulls the bass right down; C is the gentler loud-level curve. Costs nothing
      $options:
        - z: Z (flat)
        - a: A (IEC 61672)
        - c: C (IEC 61672)
    - tilt: '1.5'
      $name: Tilt (dB per octave)
      $description: A slope around 1 kHz. Bars are referenced to a 1/3-octave band (see Level Reference), so pink noise already reads flat at 0. Most music falls a little faster than pink, and 1.5 makes a typical modern mix look level, the same thing SPAN's 4.5 dB/oct default does on a plain FFT display
      $options:
        - '0': 0 (pink noise flat)
        - '1.5': 1.5 (typical mix flat)
        - '3': '3'
        - '4.5': '4.5'
        - '6': '6'
    - detector: rms
      $name: Detector
      $description: RMS adds up the power of every frequency in the band, the right reading for music and noise. Peak shows the band's loudest single frequency, closer to what a tone measures
      $options:
        - rms: RMS (band power)
        - peak: Peak (loudest bin)
    - levelReference: third_octave
      $name: Level Reference
      $description: Third-octave scales every band to the power a 1/3-octave band at the same centre would hold, so bar heights don't change when you change Bar Count or Band Layout, and pink noise reads flat. Band shows each band's true power, so wide bars read higher than narrow ones
      $options:
        - third_octave: Third-octave (independent of bar count)
        - band: Band (true band power)
    - window: hann
      $name: FFT Window
      $description: Hann is the general-purpose choice. Blackman-Harris trades a little resolution for 92 dB of dynamic range, so quiet detail next to loud tones stays visible. Flat-top reads the exact level of a tone wherever it falls, at the cost of resolution. Hamming has a narrower peak and more leakage
      $options:
        - hann: Hann
        - hamming: Hamming
        - blackman_harris: Blackman-Harris (high dynamic range)
        - flat_top: Flat-top (accurate tone levels)
    - bassDetail: '2'
      $name: Bass Detail
      $description: The resolution tiers. Each bar is measured from the fastest tier that can resolve it. High adds a tier decimated by 16, which is what makes 1/12 and 1/24-octave bass bars real measurements; Standard stops at 4; Off is a single FFT, like the classic engine
      $options:
        - '2': High (3 tiers)
        - '1': Standard (2 tiers)
        - '0': Off (single FFT)
    - channel: mix
      $name: Channel
      $description: Which signal the spectrum is taken from. Mix is all channels averaged, as before. Mid is what both speakers share, Side is the difference between them, which shows exactly where the stereo width in a mix lives
      $options:
        - mix: Mix (all channels)
        - left: Left

    - dbCeiling: -12
      $name: Display Ceiling (dBFS)
      $description: The level that draws as a full bar, before Sensitivity. Range -60 to 0. A full-scale sine is 0 dBFS; loud modern music sits around -20 per third-octave band
    - ballistics: snappy
      $name: Ballistics
      $description: How bars rise and fall, all on real time, so they move the same at any frame rate. Snappy is closest to the 1.4 feel. Analyzer falls a steady 20 dB per second like a hardware RTA. VU integrates over 300 ms. The two PPMs follow IEC 60268-10 Type I (DIN) and Type II (EBU) return rates. Custom uses the two settings below. Motion Smoothing above slows whichever you pick
      $options:

    - peakFall: gravity
      $name: Peak Fall
      $description: Gravity accelerates like a dropped object, the classic analyzer look. Linear falls at a steady rate
      $options:
        - gravity: Gravity
        - linear: Linear
    - readout: frequency
      $name: Readout Content
      $description: What the readout set up under Peak Frequency Readout shows. Loudness is ITU-R BS.1770-5 / EBU R128 momentary (400 ms), short-term (3 s) and gated integrated loudness. Full adds 4x-oversampled true peak, PLR (true peak minus integrated loudness) and stereo correlation (+1 mono, 0 wide, -1 out of phase). The loudness meters only run while they are shown
      $options:
        - frequency: Peak frequency
        - loudness: Loudness (LUFS M / S / I)
        - loudness_full: Loudness, true peak, PLR, correlation
        - both: Peak frequency and loudness
    - loudnessResetOnTrack: true
      $name: Reset Integrated Loudness On Track Change
      $description: Starts a new integrated measurement whenever the playing track changes, so the figure is per track. Off measures from when the mod started
  $name: Analysis (Precision Engine)
- position:
    - horizontalPosition: '50'
      $name: Horizontal Position
      $description: 0-100, percentage across the monitor's work area. Decimals are allowed (e.g. 50.25) for fine-grained placement -- useful since a whole-number step can be a big jump in pixels on a large monitor. IMPORTANT -- once you have moved the visualizer by keyboard or by dragging, that saved position REPLACES this field, and editing this will appear to do nothing until you clear it with the move modifier + Home (see Interaction)
    - verticalPosition: '88'
      $name: Vertical Position
      $description: 0-100, percentage down the monitor's work area. Decimals are allowed (e.g. 88.5) for fine-grained placement. Same caveat as Horizontal Position -- a saved keyboard/drag position takes priority over this field until it is cleared with the move modifier + Home
    - monitor: 1
      $name: Monitor
      $description: 1-based monitor index
    - pixelSnap: true
      $name: Pixel Snap
      $description: Puts the panel, every bar, the text and the grid on whole pixels, so edges stay razor sharp at any size and any display scaling (at 125% or 150%, sizes otherwise land on half pixels and blur). Turn off for subpixel placement, which moves the picture by fractions of a pixel at the cost of antialiased, slightly soft edges. Bar heights move smoothly either way
  $name: Position
- interaction:
    - keyMoveEnabled: true
      $name: Enable Keyboard Move
      $description: Hold the modifier below and tap a direction key to nudge the visualizer one pixel at a time, the way a window manager moves a tiled window. This is the precise way to place it -- it lands exactly where you put it, with no cursor to keep up with. Hold the Fast Key as well to jump by the larger step instead. The same combo with 1, 2, 3 or 4 switches what the direction keys steer -- 1 the visualizer, 2 the Now Playing text, 3 the frequency readout, 4 the Media Controls strip -- so everything movable is placed with one shortcut, and the choice sticks until you change it. Modifier + Home resets whichever is selected. Worth knowing -- the visualizer and the strip store a percentage that REPLACES their Position settings, so those fields stop having any effect until you reset; the two text overlays instead store a delta ADDED to their Offset settings, so those fields always still count. Also, if the strip is currently parked by Hide When Covered, nudging it still works but you will not see it move until it comes back
    - keyMoveModifier: ctrl_alt
      $name: Keyboard Move Modifier
      $description: Held down while tapping a direction key. Use a two-key combo. This mod swallows the keypress outright, so the app underneath does not fall back to its own behaviour -- it simply never hears about it. With a one-key modifier that means real losses -- Ctrl with WASD eats Ctrl+A and, worse, Ctrl+S, so a save you think you made silently does not happen. Ctrl with arrows eats word-by-word cursor movement. Pick a one-key modifier and the mod will warn you on load listing exactly what you gave up
      $options:
        - ctrl_alt: Ctrl + Alt
        - ctrl_shift: Ctrl + Shift

      $name: Keyboard Move Step
      $description: How far one press moves the visualizer, in pixels. 1 gives true pixel-by-pixel placement
    - keyMoveFastStep: 10
      $name: Keyboard Move Fast Step
      $description: How far one press moves it while the Fast Key below is also held, in pixels
    - keyMoveFineStep: '0.25'
      $name: Keyboard Move Fine Step
      $description: A subpixel step for the visualizer, used while the Fine Key is held or with Subpixel Nudges ticked in the right-click menu. Only shows as movement with Pixel Snap off (Position); with it on, the position still accumulates and the picture moves a whole pixel at a time
      $options:
        - '0.5': 1/2 pixel
        - '0.25': 1/4 pixel
        - '0.125': 1/8 pixel
        - '0.0625': 1/16 pixel
    - keyMoveFineKey: none
      $name: Keyboard Move Fine Key
      $description: Held alongside the modifier for the fine step. Must not be one of the modifier's keys or the Fast Key. None leaves fine steps to the right-click menu's Subpixel Nudges

        - win: Win
        - none: None (disable fast step)
    - dragEnabled: false
      $name: Enable Drag-to-Move
      $description: Hold the modifier + mouse button below anywhere over the visualizer and drag to reposition it. Bar rendering pauses for the duration of the drag -- only the background/border box (if Background is enabled) moves. Double-click the same combo without dragging to clear a dragged position. Note this rides a global mouse hook and has to repaint the whole visualizer to keep up with the cursor, so on a heavy shape or a high bar count it can feel sluggish next to the keyboard move above -- which is why it's off by default now
    - dragModifier: ctrl
      $name: Drag Modifier Key
      $description: Held together with the mouse button below to start a drag

      $name: Right-Click Menu
      $description: Right-click the visualizer for a menu of quick settings (shape, colours, analysis, audio source, overlays, pause). It only opens where the visualizer is actually showing on the desktop, never through a window covering it. Ctrl + Right-Click leaves a plain right-click to the desktop

    - enabled: false
      $name: Enabled
      $description: Adds a small Previous / Play-Pause / Next control strip, wired to whatever app is currently playing media (Spotify, a browser, etc.) via the same native Windows media session API the Now Playing text reads from. Unlike the visualizer itself, this strip sits on top of other windows rather than behind the desktop icons, since it has to actually receive your clicks
    - iconColor: '#FFFFFFFF'
      $name: Icon Color
      $description: 'Color for the built-in Previous/Play/Pause/Next glyphs, used whenever a custom icon path below is left blank. Format is #AARRGGBB, #RRGGBB, rgba(r, g, b, a), or rgb(r, g, b)'

      $description: Gap between buttons, in pixels
    - plateColor: '#00000000'
      $name: Backing Plate Color
      $description: 'A panel drawn behind the whole icon strip. Fully transparent by default, so your icons sit directly on the wallpaper with nothing behind them. Raise the alpha if pale icons are hard to pick out against a light wallpaper -- e.g. #8C141414 for a soft dark plate. Format is #AARRGGBB, #RRGGBB, rgba(r, g, b, a), or rgb(r, g, b)'
    - platePadding: 0
      $name: Backing Plate Padding
      $description: Breathing room between the icons and the edge of the backing plate, in pixels. This grows the strip itself rather than shrinking the icons, so raising it never makes the buttons smaller or harder to click. Note that it grows the strip whether or not the plate is visible, which very slightly shifts where the Horizontal/Vertical Position percentages land
    - plateCornerRadius: 8
      $name: Backing Plate Corner Radius
      $description: Roundness of the backing plate corners, in pixels. Only used when the plate color above has some alpha
    - plateBorderSize: 0
      $name: Backing Plate Border Size
      $description: Outline thickness around the backing plate, in pixels. 0 disables it. The border draws whether or not the plate itself has any fill, so you can have an outline on its own with nothing behind the icons
    - plateBorderColor: '#40FFFFFF'
      $name: Backing Plate Border Color
      $description: 'Color of the backing plate outline. Format is #AARRGGBB, #RRGGBB, rgba(r, g, b, a), or rgb(r, g, b)'
    - hideWhenCovered: false
      $name: Hide When Covered
      $description: The strip is topmost, so by default it stays on screen over whatever else you have open. Turn this on to have it get out of the way while a real application window sits underneath it, and come back when that window moves or closes. Note that while it is parked out of the way it is genuinely hidden, so keyboard nudges (move target 4) still apply but you will not see them land until it comes back. Coverage is re-checked once a second, not instantly
    - coveredThresholdPercent: '50'
      $name: Hide When Covered - Threshold
      $description: How much of the strip has to be underneath a window before it hides. Only used when Hide When Covered is on

    - horizontalPosition: '50'
      $name: Horizontal Position
      $description: 0-100, percentage across the monitor's work area. Decimals are allowed (e.g. 50.25) for precise placement, independent of where the visualizer itself sits. The strip can also be nudged a pixel at a time with the keyboard -- see Interaction, where it is move target 4. IMPORTANT -- once nudged, that saved position REPLACES this field, and editing this will appear to do nothing until you clear it with the move modifier + 4 then Home
    - verticalPosition: '95'
      $name: Vertical Position
      $description: 0-100, percentage down the monitor's work area. Decimals allowed. Same caveat as Horizontal Position -- a saved keyboard position takes priority over this field until it is cleared
    - anchor: screen
      $name: Anchor
      $description: Screen places the strip with the two Position percentages above. A panel corner pins it inside that corner of the visualizer's background panel instead, so it moves with the visualizer (drags included) and the Position settings are ignored. Give the panel enough padding on that side to hold it
      $options:
        - screen: Screen (Position settings)

      $description: Strip is the three buttons. Card is a small media card in the same place, sized from Icon Size and Icon Spacing - the album art (hover it for previous / play / next), a seek bar (click or drag), a speaker button that switches the Windows default output in one click, and a volume slider (drag it, or scroll anywhere on the card)

    - padding: '24'
      $name: Padding
      $description: Space between the bars/waveform and the panel edge, in pixels. One value for all sides, or four space-separated values for left, right, top, bottom -- so you can grow the panel more on one side without moving the bars or resizing anything else. Negative values shrink that side inward instead, past the bars if pushed far enough
    - cornerRadius: '14'

      $name: Target FPS
      $description: Caps how often the visualizer redraws itself. 0 matches your display's refresh rate, whatever it is. With the Direct3D 11 renderer a frame where nothing moved is skipped entirely, so a high target costs far less than it used to during quiet or steady passages
    - pauseOnFullscreen: true
      $name: Pause On Fullscreen
      $description: Stops rendering while any window is fullscreen, since the visualizer would be hidden behind it anyway
    - pauseWhenSilentSeconds: 10
      $name: Pause When Silent (seconds)
      $description: After this long without audio, drawing drops to a trickle that presents nothing unless something actually changes. 0 disables this behavior, and Deep Idle with it
    - deepIdle: true
      $name: Deep Idle
      $description: Five seconds after Pause When Silent kicks in, stops the audio stream itself and watches Windows' own peak meter four times a second instead, restarting the moment anything plays. A running capture stream registers an audio power request, which can keep the PC from sleeping; a stopped one doesn't. Turn off only if the visualizer is slow to wake for a very quiet source
    - perfStats: false
      $name: Performance Stats
      $description: Every 30 seconds, writes one line to the Windhawk log (turn on Enable logging) with what the visualizer actually cost - engine wakes and milliseconds, analyses and FFTs, render ticks, frames presented versus skipped, text redraws, compositor commits and buffer uploads, and time spent playing / trickling / in deep idle. All per second, so settings and PCs compare directly. Counting is always on and costs a few atomic adds per frame; this only switches the log line

    - obscuredThresholdPercent: '100'
      $name: Pause When Covered - Threshold
      $description: How much of the visualizer's box (bars plus background padding) has to be underneath real application windows before rendering pauses. 100% means it only pauses when completely hidden, which is the safest setting and the old behavior. Lower values pause sooner and save more power, at the risk of stopping while a sliver of it is still peeking out. Coverage is measured as actual area across every covering window combined, not per-window, so two half-covering windows count as fully covered
      $options:

      $name: Workload
      $description: Where the work runs. Hybrid analyses on the CPU, which is a fraction of a percent of one core, and draws on the GPU, the cheapest split on almost every PC. GPU moves the analysis onto the graphics chip too, so the CPU only copies audio. CPU does everything on the processor, drawing included (software rendering), leaving the GPU nothing but Windows' own compositing. NPU runs the FFTs on an Intel AI Boost NPU and is experimental; see the readme for why it rarely saves power

    - renderDevice: auto
      $name: Drawing Device
      $description: Which GPU draws. Auto uses the one your chosen monitor is plugged into, which avoids copying every frame from one GPU to another and is the right answer almost everywhere. Integrated and Discrete force a GPU type, and fall back to Auto (with a warning) if this PC does not have one. CPU draws in software, the same as Workload = CPU
      $options:

      $description: Direct3D 11 draws everything with one tiny shader from a buffer of bar heights, skips any frame where nothing moved, keeps the text on its own surface that only redraws when the text changes, and tells Windows when the panel is opaque so it copies instead of blending. Direct2D is the 1.5 path, unchanged, including Smooth Mode's batching; it is kept for comparison and as the automatic fallback
      $options:
        - d3d11: Direct3D 11 (recommended)
        - direct2d: Direct2D (1.5 path)
    - opaquePanel: auto
      $name: Opaque Panel
      $description: When the background panel can't show anything behind it (Blur on, or a fully opaque colour) and Auto-Hide is off, the Direct3D 11 renderer marks it opaque so Windows composes it without blending, with the rounded corners cut by the compositor. Off always blends, for comparison
      $options:
        - auto: Auto
        - 'off': 'Off'
    - npuRuntimePath: ''
      $name: NPU Runtime Folder
      $description: The folder that contains openvino_c.dll, or the root of an extracted OpenVINO archive. Leave blank to search the usual places - INTEL_OPENVINO_DIR, Program Files\Intel\openvino*, a pip-installed openvino package, and PATH. Only used when Workload is NPU
    - smoothMode: auto
      $name: Smooth Mode
      $description: Frame timing locked to the display's refresh so every frame lands on its own refresh, and motion that scales with real elapsed time. Target FPS is rounded to an even fraction of the refresh rate (60 on a 144 Hz screen runs at 72) because that is what makes motion even. With the Direct2D renderer it also bakes the panel and batches the bars. Auto turns it on when drawing runs on an integrated GPU or the CPU. On works with any GPU. Off is the 1.4 timing
      $options:
        - auto: Auto (integrated GPU or CPU drawing)
        - 'on': 'On'
        - 'off': Off (1.4 timing)

      $name: Warn About Invalid Settings
      $description: Several settings here are free-text fields -- colors, positions, padding, corner radii, icon paths. Windhawk will happily save a typo in one of them, and the mod then quietly falls back to a default, so the setting looks saved but does nothing. With this on, a summary window appears listing exactly which fields couldn't be read, what you typed, and what format was expected. Turn it off if you'd rather it stayed silent -- the same list still goes to the Windhawk mod log either way

// ---- Precision analysis core (Analysis Engine = Precision) ---------------------
//
// Everything in here is plain C++ with no Windows dependency, so it can be
// compiled and tested on its own against a reference implementation. The mod
// pastes it in verbatim.
//
// What it replaces, and why. The 1.4 analysis ran one complex FFT over real
// data, summed it into 7 fixed bands, and then every bar interpolated between
// those 7 numbers. Bar Count and FFT Size changed how many bars were drawn,
// not how much the bars knew. This core gives every bar its own frequency band
// with its own edges, measured straight from the spectrum:
//
//   * a real-input FFT (an N/2-point complex FFT plus a post-twiddle), which
//     is half the work of running a complex FFT on real data;
//   * three resolution tiers: the signal as captured, decimated by 4 and
//     decimated by 16, each analysed with the same FFT size. Bass bands come
//     from the long, finely resolved windows, treble from the short, fast ones,
//     so a 1/24-octave bar at 50 Hz is a real measurement instead of a smear;
//   * band layouts on log / linear / mel / Bark / ERB scales, IEC 61260-1
//     fractional-octave bands, or equal-tempered musical notes;
//   * A / C / Z weighting (IEC 61672-1) and a dB-per-octave tilt, added per
//     band in dB, which costs nothing;
//   * frame-rate-independent ballistics: every coefficient is 1 - exp(-dt/tau)
//     from the time that actually passed, so 60, 144 and 240 Hz all move the
//     bars at the same speed;
//   * BS.1770-5 loudness (momentary, short-term, gated integrated), 4x
//     oversampled true peak, and a stereo correlation meter.
//
// Cost, at FFT Size 2048 and 144 FPS: one 1024-point complex FFT per frame for
// the top tier, the lower tiers only when enough new decimated samples have
// arrived to be worth it (every 1.5 and 6 frames). Well under 1% of one core.

//
// True peak: 4x oversampling through a 64-tap polyphase interpolator
// (Kaiser-windowed sinc, cut off at the original Nyquist), the maximum
// absolute value over every original and interpolated sample, in dBTP.
//

//   * SetTruePeak(false) leaves the interpolator out entirely (the readout
//     only shows true peak in its full form);
//   * a window that provably can't raise the peak isn't interpolated. Phase
//     p's output is a_p = sum_j h_p[j] x[j] over the kTpTaps newest samples,
//     so |a_p| <= sum_j |h_p[j]| |x[j]| <= S max_j |x[j]|, S = max_p sum_j
//     |h_p[j]|. Computed in float, a 16-term dot product is off by at most
//     gamma_16 = 16u / (1 - 16u) < 2^-19 of that bound (u = 2^-24), plus
//     underflow terms that only matter below 1e-30. tpBound_ is S (1 + 2^-12)
//     rounded up, which covers both that and the rounding of |x| tpBound_.
//     So if every sample in the window had |x| tpBound_ <= truePeak_ when it
//     arrived, every float a_p the loop would compute is <= truePeak_ then,
//     and truePeak_ only grows until Reset(): max(truePeak_, |a_p|) would
//     leave it unchanged, and skipping the evaluation is exact. hot_[c] counts
//     the pushes for which a sample that failed that test is still inside
//     channel c's window. On music near its own peak this saves little; on

// ---- NPU audio analysis (Workload = NPU) ----------------------------------------
//
// What the NPU can and can't do here. An NPU is a matrix-multiply engine with
// no graphics pipeline: it can't rasterise a bar or present a frame, so
// drawing always stays on Drawing Device. What it can take is the FFT, as long
// as the FFT is written as matrix multiplies, which is the shape of work an
// NPU is built for.
//
// The FFT is expressed as a "four-step" DFT. With N = N1 * N2 and the input
// laid out as an N1 x N2 matrix (row-major, so no reshuffling of the samples):
//
//   Y = F1 . x          N1-point DFT down each column   (two real matmuls)
//   Z = Y (*) T         twiddle factors, elementwise    (complex multiply)
//   X = [Zre|Zim] . G   N2-point DFT along each row     (one real matmul)
//
// G packs the complex N2-point DFT as a real 2*N2 x 2*N2 block matrix, so the
// last step is a single matmul that emits [Xre|Xim]. Bin k = k1 + N1*k2 lands
// at row k1, column k2 (real) and N2 + k2 (imaginary). For N = 8192 that is
// 64 x 128, and the constant matrices total about 350 KB.
//
// F1 and G carry 1/N1 and 1/N2, so the NPU computes X/N. Intel's NPU runs in
// FP16, whose ceiling is 65504; unnormalised, an 8192-point bin can reach
// 8192 times the input level and would overflow. The CPU multiplies N back
// in, so everything downstream of VizFFT sees exactly the numbers it always
// has.
//
// The model is built in memory as ONNX and handed to Intel's OpenVINO runtime,
// which is how Intel exposes its NPU. OpenVINO is loaded at runtime through its
// flat C API, so nothing here links against it and the mod still builds and
// runs on machines without it. ONNX rather than OpenVINO's own IR because ONNX
// carries its weights inline: IR would need a weights tensor created through
// an element-type enum whose numbering has changed between OpenVINO releases.
// Input and output tensors are the request's own, for the same reason.
//
// An honest note on cost, because this mod is built around measuring it: the
// CPU FFT is already a fraction of a millisecond per block, roughly 90 blocks a
// second at FFT Size 1024. Moving it to the NPU frees that CPU time but wakes
// the NPU at the same rate, so whether package power goes down is something to
// measure on your own machine, not something to assume. The log reports mean
// and worst-case NPU time per block every 30 s for exactly that reason.

// ---- Audio engine: capture, analysis and what the renderer reads -----------------
//
// 1.5 ran two threads to get audio onto the screen. A capture thread woke on
// every WASAPI event, about 100 times a second while anything played, and a
// pacing thread woke once per frame to post the render tick. Every wake is a
// core leaving a sleep state, which is the cost this mod has always been built
// around, so 2.0 merges them: the pacing thread also owns the loopback client,
// and once per frame it drains whatever audio has arrived, analyses it, and
// posts the tick. Audio and video share one wake.
//
// That only works because loopback is drained by polling rather than by the
// event, so the client is opened with a 500 ms buffer (1.5 asked for 20 ms,
// which was fine for an event every 10 ms and is not for a frame every 33 ms
// at a 30 FPS target). The event is still registered; it is what the thread
// waits on while idle, because WASAPI only signals it when audio arrives.
//
// Idle has three steps now:
//   playing       one wake per frame, as above.
//   trickle       Pause When Silent reached. Loopback: the audio event wakes
//                 the thread, which only drains the packet unless it is
//                 louder than the audible level (then it analyses and draws
//                 at once, so waking up costs no latency); otherwise one
//                 analysis + render tick every 250 ms. An app holding a silent
//                 stream open signals the event 100 times a second, and those
//                 wakes now cost a drain each instead of a full frame. An
//                 input device signals every device period whatever it hears,
//                 so for one the thread just polls every 250 ms.
//   deep idle     5 s after that, loopback only and only with a working peak
//                 meter: the stream is stopped and the endpoint's peak meter
//                 is read 4 times a second instead. A running capture stream
//                 registers an audio power request, which can hold the PC out
//                 of sleep; a stopped one doesn't. A meter reading above the
//                 audible level (the same -70 dBFS the engine uses, Input Gain
//                 included) only restarts the stream and goes back to trickle
//                 for a 1 s look; the engine's own test then decides whether
//                 it is playing. An input device stays in trickle: once its
//                 stream is stopped, its peak meter can read 0 for good.

// ---- Direct3D 11 renderer (Renderer = Direct3D 11) -----------------------------------
//
// Why a second renderer, when Smooth Mode already batched the bars. Direct2D
// tessellates on the CPU and validates and saves Direct3D state around every
// batch; for a few hundred moving shapes that per-call CPU work, not the
// GPU, is what the 1.5 measurements kept pointing at. This renderer draws
// every bar, dot, cap, spoke and scope segment as an instanced quad from one
// tiny vertex shader that reads the bar heights straight from a buffer: the
// CPU writes about 16 KB per frame (two floats per bar) and issues a handful
// of draw calls, whatever the bar count. The pixel shader computes exact
// antialiased coverage analytically, so edges look like Direct2D's.
//
// Three further savings come from how the frame reaches the screen:
//
//   * Skip unchanged frames. A hash of everything that decides the picture
//     (bar heights to a quarter pixel, colours, the trace) is compared with
//     the last frame presented; if nothing moved, nothing is drawn or
//     presented, so DWM has nothing to recompose. During steady or quiet
//     passages and every idle state that is most frames.
//   * Two surfaces instead of one. The animated swap chain covers only the
//     panel, not the room reserved around it for text; the text lives on the
//     old full-size surface, which is redrawn only when the text or its fade
//     changes. DWM's per-frame work scales with the area that changes.
//   * Opaque panel. When the panel can't show anything behind it (Blur on, or
//     a fully opaque colour), its swap chain is created with alpha ignored and
//     the rounded corners come from a DirectComposition clip. DWM then copies
//     instead of blending, which Chromium measured as 3.12 W against 2.28 W.
//
// The same shaders also carry the GPU Workload: four compute passes run the
// whole precision analysis on the GPU and write the bar buffer the vertex
// shader reads, so nothing comes back to the CPU but an 8-byte stats block,
// read two frames late without waiting.

// ---- Smooth Mode: display-locked frame pacing -----------------------------------
//
// Why the 1.4 timer isn't enough on its own, using the 1.1.0 changelog's own
// measurement: 144 FPS requested, 141.7 delivered, the gap being timer wake
// latency added to every interval. On a 144 Hz panel that is two or three
// refreshes a second that get no new frame, so the previous one is shown
// twice -- a stutter you see several times a second. A 60 FPS target on a
// 144 Hz panel is worse in a different way: 144 / 60 = 2.4, so frames are held
// for 2, then 3, then 2 refreshes, which reads as judder however accurate the
// timer is.
//
// So in Smooth Mode the schedule comes from DWM's composition clock instead of
// from "interval since the last frame":
//   * the frame rate is the refresh rate divided by a whole number, the one
//     nearest the Target FPS, so every frame is shown for the same number of
//     refreshes;
//   * every wake is placed half a refresh after a vblank, which is as far as a
//     present can get from DWM's composition deadline on either side, so
//     ordinary scheduling jitter can't push some frames to the next refresh;
//   * deadlines advance on an absolute timeline, so wake latency doesn't
//     accumulate into drift.
// It still wakes once per frame, never once per vblank, so the idle-power
// behaviour the README measures is kept. DWM is asked for its clock twice a
// second, not per frame.
